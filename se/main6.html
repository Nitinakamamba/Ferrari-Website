<p><span>The Ferrari GTC4Lusso is a four-seat grand tourer</span> produced by Italian car manufacturer Ferrari. The Ferrari GTC4Lusso is a successor to the Ferrari FF.</p>
<p>Like the FF it replaces, the GTC4Lusso is a 3-door shooting-brake with all-wheel drivetrain, and is powered by a front-mid mounted 6.3-litre V12. 
The GTC4Lusso's 6,262 cc (382.1 cu in) Ferrari F140 65° V12 engine rated 690 PS (507 kW; 681 hp) at 8,000 rpm and 697 N·m (514 lb·ft) at 5,750rpm,also thanks to a compression ratio raised to 13.5:1. Ferrari claims a top speed of 335 km/h (208 mph), unchanged from the FF,and a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration time of 3.4 seconds. 
The car uses an improved version (dubbed 4RM Evo) of Ferrari's patented four-wheel drive system introduced on the FF, integrated with four-wheel steering into 4RM-S. 
It was unveiled in the 2016 Geneva Motor Show.</p>
<p>The GTC4Lusso T is a rear wheel drive only version of GTC4Lusso with 3.9-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine, but retains the 4WS four-wheel steering system. The GTC4Lusso T contains a 3,855 cc (235.2 cu in) Ferrari F154 twin turbocharged V8 engine rated 610 PS (449 kW; 602 hp) at 7,500 rpm and 760 N·m (561 ft·lb) at 3,000–5,250 rpm. According to the manufacturer the car can reach a top speed of over 320 km/h (199 mph) and accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.5 seconds. The vehicle was unveiled in the 2016 Paris Motor Show.</p>
<p>The body style of GTC4Lusso is similar to the one of the Ferrari FF. The rear features Ferrari's signature Quad Circular Rear Lights (last seen on the Ferrari F430) and its interior contains a Dual Cockpit Concept Design, separating the Driver Cockpit & Passenger Cockpit by a central divider. The front of the vehicle is presented with a single grille that provides all the necessary cooling. The GTC4Lusso is a further refinement of the shooting-brake coupe, reinterpreting the concept with an extremely streamlined, tapered shape that gives it an almost fastback-like silhouette.</p>
