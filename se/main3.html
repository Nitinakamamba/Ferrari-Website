<p>The Enzo Ferrari (also unofficially referred to as the Ferrari Enzo) is a 12 cylinder mid-engine sports car named after the company's founder, Enzo Ferrari. It was built in 2002 using Formula One technology, such as a carbon-fibre body, F1-style electrohydraulic shift transmission, and carbon fibre-reinforced silicon carbide ceramic composite disc brakes. Also used are technologies not allowed in F1 such as active aerodynamics and traction control. The Enzo Ferrari generates incredible amounts of downforce which is achieved by the front underbody flaps, the small adjustable rear spoiler and the rear diffuser working in conjunction, 3363 N (756 lbf) is generated at 124 mph (200 km/h) 7602 N (1709 lbf) is attained at 186 mph (299 km/h) before decreasing to 5738 N (1290 lbf) at top speed.[8]

The Enzo's F140 B V12 engine was the first of a new generation for Ferrari. It is based on the design of the V8 engine found in the Maserati Quattroporte, using the same basic design and 104 mm (4.1 in) bore spacing. This design replaced the former architectures seen in V12 and V8 engines used in most other contemporary Ferraris. The 2005 F430 is the second Ferrari to get a version of this new powerplant. Ferrari developed the Ferrari FXX from this car.</p>
<p>The Enzo is a longitudinally-mounted Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout vehicle with a 43.9/56.1 front/rear weight distribution. The powerplant is Ferrari's F140B naturally aspirated 65° V12 engine with DOHC 4 valves per cylinder, variable valve timing and Bosch Motronic ME7 fuel injection with a displacement of 5,999 cc (6.0 L; 366.1 cu in) producing 660 PS (651 bhp; 485 kW) at 7,800 rpm and 657 N⋅m; 485 lbf⋅ft (67 kg⋅m) at 5,500 rpm. [13] The redline limit is 8,200 rpm.</p>
<p>The Enzo can accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.14 seconds and can reach 100 mph (160 km/h) in 6.6 seconds. The ¼ mile (~400 m) time is about 11 seconds, on skidpad it has reached 1.05 g and the <span>top speed has been recorded to be as high as 355 kilometres</span> per hour (221 mph).[22] It is rated at 7 miles per US gallon (34 L/100 km; 8.4 mpg‑imp) in the city, 12 miles per US gallon (20 L/100 km; 14 mpg‑imp) on the highway and 8 miles per US gallon (29 L/100 km; 9.6 mpg‑imp) combined.[23]

Despite the Enzo's extraordinary performance and price, the Ferrari 430 Scuderia (an improved version of Ferrari's standard F430 production car) is capable of lapping the Ferrari test track just 0.1s slower than the Enzo and the Porsche Carrera GT was 1.12 seconds faster in direct comparison on the only 0.98 miles (1,577 m) long Autodromo del Levante near Bari.

Evo magazine tested the Enzo on the famed Nordschleife Circuit and ran a 7:25.21 lap time. The Enzo in the test had a broken electronic damper. They also tested it at Bedford Autodrome West circuit where it lapped 1:21.3 which is 1.1 s slower than the Porsche Carrera GT but faster than the Litchfield Type-25.

The Enzo has a laptime of 58.31 seconds at Silverstone Stowe Circuit with a passenger on board. It pulled a maximum of 1.2g lateral acceleration during the run.

The Enzo Ferrari has a power to weight ratio of 2.03 kg (4.48 lb) per horsepower.</p>
