<p><b>The Ferrari 488</b> is a mid-engined sports car produced by the Italian sports car manufacturer Ferrari, introduced in 2015 to replace the previous 458. The car is an update to the 458 with notable exterior and performance changes.

The car is powered by a 3.9-litre twin-turbocharged V8, smaller in displacement and higher in output than the 458's naturally aspirated engine. The 488 GTB was named "The Supercar of the Year 2015" by car magazine Top Gear, as well as becoming Motor Trend's 2017 "Best Driver's Car".</p>
<p>
<b>Specifications</b>
</p>
<p>

<b>Engine</b>
</p>
<p>
The 488 GTB is powered by a 3,902 cc (3.9 L; 238.1 cu in) (488 cc per cylinder, thus the name) all-aluminum dry sump unit of the Ferrari F154 V8 engine family.[3] Turbocharged with two parallel ball-bearing twin-scroll turbochargers supplied by IHI/Honeywell and two air-to-air intercoolers, the turbine wheels are made of low-density TiAl alloy often used in jet engines to reduce inertia and resist high temperatures within the turbocharger. The engine produces 670 PS (661 bhp; 493 kW) at 8,000 rpm and 760 N·m (561 lb·ft) of torque at 3,000 rpm.[7] This results in a specific power output of 126.3 kW (171.7 PS; 169.4 hp) per litre and specific torque output of 194.8 N·m (144 lb·ft) per litre, both records for a Ferrari car.
</p>
<p>
<b>Transmission</b>
</p>
<p>
The only available transmission for the 488 is an automated manual dual-clutch 7-speed F1 gearbox manufactured for Ferrari by Getrag, based on the gearbox used in the 458.[8]

</p>
<p>
<b>Handling</b>
</p>
<p>
Improved carbon-ceramic brakes are supplied on the 488, derived from technology used in the LaFerrari, constructed with new materials that reduce the time needed to achieve optimum operating temperature. Disc sizes are 398 mm at the front, and 360 mm at the rear. These advancements reportedly reduce stopping distances by 9% over the 458.[8]

A new 5-spoke alloy wheel was designed for the 488, measuring 51 cm (20 in) front and rear. Front tires measure 245/35 with rears 305/30.[3]
</p>
<p>
<b>Performance</b>
</p>
<p>
Claimed manufacturer performance for the 488 GTB is 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 3.0 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 8.3 seconds, covering the quarter mile in 10.45 seconds and continuing to a top speed in excess of 330 km/h (205 mph).[3]

The 488 GTB has a power to weight ratio of 2.2 kg (4.85 lb) per horsepower, matching that of Ferrari’s own F12berlinetta.
