<p><b>The Ferrari Portofino</b> is a grand touring sports car produced by the Italian automotive manufacturer Ferrari. It is a two-door 2+2 hard top convertible. The car is named after the Italian Portofino village and also succeeds the company's previous V8 grand tourer, the California T. The car was unveiled at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show</p>
<p>
<b>Specifications</b>
</p>
<p>
Succeeding the company's successful V8 grand tourer, the California, the Portofino aims to strike the same balance between an easy to drive GT car and a typical Ferrari sports car as set by the California. The carries over the same philosophy as its predecessor but is now more refined and agile courtesy of new design and technical elements.
</p>
<p>
<b>Chassis</b>
</p>
<p>
The chassis of the Portofino is made of 12 different aluminium alloys with much of its components now integrated. The A-pillar, which consisted of 21 separate components is now a single piece. Hollow castings allow for increased structural rigidity, increasing it by 35% than the California T's chassis.
</p>
<p>
<b>Weight</b>
</p>
<p>
Weight saving has been kept in focus while the development of the Portofino was carried out. Ferrari engineers managed to shave weight from the powertrain, dashboard structure, air-conditioning and heating system and electronic system of the car resulting in a weight of 1,664 kg (3,668 lb), making the car 80 kg (176 lb) lighter than its predecessor.
</p>
<p>
<b>Engine, transmission and performance</b>
</p>
<p>
the 3.9-litre F154BD twin-turbocharged V8 engine
The engine, a 3,855 cc (3.9 L) F154BD twin-turbocharged V8, is the same as in the GTC4Lusso T, but yields a slightly de-tuned power output of 591 hp (441 kW; 599 PS) at 7,500 rpm and 560 N·m (413 ft·lb) of torque at 3,000-4,250 rpm. Changes to the engine include a 10% pressure increase in the combustion chamber, revised connecting rods and pistons and a single cast exhaust manifold. The car retains the 7-speed dual clutch transmission from its predecessor but features a new software to allow for faster gear shifts. The exhaust system has been tweaked to give the car a proper sound note while maintaining its grand touring nature, featuring an adjustable electric bypass valve that monitors the engine's sound according to the driving conditions. The Portofino can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 3.5 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 10.8 seconds and can attain a top speed of 320 km/h (199 mph).
</p>
<p>
<b>Suspension and steering</b>
</p>
<p>
The Portofino features magentorheological dampers, a carry over from the California, with an improved software to maintain good ride quality even though having a stiffer suspension system that the California. Like the company's V12 grand tourer offering the 812 Superfast, the Portofino features an electrically assisted power steering. Both the suspension system and steering become increasingly responsive when the car is in sports mode.
</p>
<p>
<b>Interior</b>
</p>
<p>
The interior of the Portofino was developed after taking input from various clients. The rear seats now have an increased leg room (increased by 5 centimetres) and the infotainment system is now more advanced and easy to use, featuring a 10.2-inch display screen in the centre console featuring Apple CarPlay, as in its predecessor. The air conditioning system has been refined as well and is now 25% faster and 50% quieter than the California's with the multifunction steering being a carry over from California.
