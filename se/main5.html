<p>The Ferrari 812 Superfast is a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive grand tourer produced by Italian sports car manufacturer Ferrari that made its debut at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. The 812 Superfast is the successor to the F12berlinetta.</p>
<p>The car has an enlarged 6,496 cc (6.5 L; 396.4 cu in) version of the F140 V12 compared to the 6.3-litre engine used in the F12 berlinetta. The engine produces 800 PS (789 bhp; 588 kW) at 8,500 rpm and 718 N·m (530 lb·ft) of torque at 7,000 rpm.[7][8] The 812 Superfast's engine is, as of 2018, the most powerful naturally aspirated production car engine ever made. 
Despite having possessed powertrain technology expertise in overcharging (turbocharging) and hybrid disciplines, Ferrari has made clear that none of those technologies are being incorporated in the legendary FR (front-engine, rear wheel-drive), V12-engined berlinetta design -- at present and in future -- due to heritage reasons. </p>
<p>The transmission for the 812 Superfast is a dual-clutch 7-speed F1 automated manual gearbox manufactured for Ferrari by Getrag, based on the gearbox used in the Ferrari 458.</p>
<p>The 812 Superfast has 20-inch wheels at the front and the rear. The tyres are Pirelli P Zero with codes of 275/35 ZR 20 for the front tires and 315/35 ZR 20 for the rear. The brakes are carbon-ceramic Brembo Extreme Design disc brakes, which Ferrari claims have 5.8% improved braking performance from 100 km/h to 0 km/h as compared to the F12berlinetta.The front brakes have a diameter of 398 mm (15.7 in) and the rear brakes have a diameter of 360 mm (14 in). </p>
<p>Ferrari has stated that the FR (front-engine, rear wheel-drive) V12 vehicle platform -- part of the brand's heritage -- is not easy to refine and has presented various developmental challenges. As such, a combination of complicated aerodynamics technology is used to complement the 812 Superfast's chassis control system. It includes a mix of active and passive aerodynamics to improve drag coefficient values over the F12berlinetta. The front of the car is designed to increase downforce and includes intakes for front brake cooling, as well as ducts to increase underbody air flow. The bonnet of the car also features channels to move air through to the side of the car for additional downforce. The rear diffuser of the 812 Superfast has active flaps that can open up at high speeds to further reduce drag. </p>
<p>Ferrari claims that the 812 Superfast has a top speed of 211 mph (340 km/h) with a 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) acceleration time of 2.9 seconds.The car has a power to weight ratio of 2.04 kg (4.50 lb) per horsepower(ps). This has been declared by Ferrari the 'perfect power to weight ratio'. The 812 Superfast is the first Ferrari equipped with EPS (Electronic Power Steering). It also shares the rear-wheel-steering system (Virtual Short Wheelbase 2.0) borrowed from the limited edition F12tdf. The weight distribution of the car is 47% front, 53% rear.</p>
