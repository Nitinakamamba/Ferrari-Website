<p><span>The LaFerrari</span>, project name F150 (also unofficially referred to as the Ferrari LaFerrari or Ferrari F70)[4] is a limited production hybrid sports car built by Italian automotive manufactuter Ferrari.[5] LaFerrari literally means "The Ferrari" in Italian and in some other Romance languages, in this context in the sense that it is the "definitive" Ferrari.</p>
<p><span>The LaFerrari Aperta</span> is a limited version (210 units) of the LaFerrari. Initially, 200 cars were sold with an additional nine reserved for use during the Ferrari 70th Anniversary celebrations.[18] One more model was later sold by auction.[19] The LaFerrari Aperta comes with a removable carbon-fibre hard top and a removable soft top. Other changes include more efficient powertrain's control electronics, re-angled radiators to direct air flow out along the underbody rather than over the bonnet, a longer front air dam to help boost downforce, an L-shaped flap on the upper corner of each windscreen pillar to reduce compression on the rear of the cabin in the absence of a roof, different butterfly door angles with different wheel arches and a new carbon fibre insert allowing the doors to rotate.[20]

The car was unveiled at the 2016 Paris Auto Show. Like past convertible Ferrari models, it uses the Aperta label to denote its removable roof. According to Ferrari, all units were already sold to customers via invitation.</p>
<p>The LaFerrari is the <span>first mild hybrid produced by the Italian Automotive marque</span>, providing the highest power output of any Ferrari road car whilst decreasing fuel consumption by 40 percent.[24] LaFerrari's internal combustion petrol powerplant is a longitudinally-mounted Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout Ferrari F140 direct injection 65° V12 engine with a displacement of 6,262 cc (6.3 L) generating a maximum power output of 800 PS (789 hp; 588 kW) at 9,000 rpm and 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,750 rpm,[25][2] supplemented by a 163 PS (120 kW; 161 hp) KERS unit (called HY-KERS), which will provide short bursts of extra power.[26] The KERS system adds extra power to the combustion engine's output level for a total of 963 PS (708 kW; 950 hp) and a combined torque of 900 N⋅m (664 lb⋅ft).[2][27] Ferrari claims CO2 emissions of 330 g/km. The engine's bore X stroke is 94 mm × 75.2 mm (3.70 in × 2.96 in) with a compression ratio of 13.5:1 and a specific power output of 94 kW (128 PS) per litre.[2] It is connected to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.</p>

<li>Ferrari LaFerrari: performance
The performance figures of the Ferrari LaFerrari set a new standard for road cars. The 0-62mph sprint takes “less than three seconds”, 0-124mph takes “under seven seconds” and it can lap Ferrari’s Fiorano test track in Italy in under one minute 20 seconds – or five seconds faster than the Enzo.

Ferrari has only revealed that the LaFerrari's top speed is in excess of 217mph (350 km/h) but car is said to be capable of considerably more.

<li>Ferrari LaFerrari: engine 
Power for the LaFerrari comes from a 789bhp version of the F12’s 6.3-litre V12, working in tandem with a 161bhp electric motor to drive the rear axle. Ferrari claims the motor’s high torque output at low revs allowed it to tune the V12 to produce its best at high revs. </li>

The result is huge power on tap, at any speed, in any gear. Peak power arrives at a heady 9,000rpm and maximum torque of more than 900Nm is delivered at 6,750rpm. The tricky job of marshalling all that thrush is handed to Ferrari's seven-speed dual-clutch F1 gearbox.</li>

<li>Ferrari LaFerrari: design
The LaFerrari is 4,702mm long and 1,992mm wide with 2,650mm wheelbase. Advanced carbon fibre tub construction helps to achieve a dry weight of around 1,250kg. To cope with the awesome power and performance, the La Ferrari's front Pirelli P Zero tyres are bigger than on the Enzo, plus there’s a new generation of Brembo carbon ceramic brakes. 

Active aerodyamics play a key role, too, and include a flexible front diffuser and underbody vanes, as well as an active rear spoiler and diffuser. This removes the need for an ungainly fixed rear wing, and the movable parts allow downforce to be maximised or drag reduced as required.

The design has been honed in the F1 team’s wind tunnel, and picks up where the Enzo left off with a low, pointed nose and gaping air intakes. The lower front wing, which appears to hang on a single strut, is a nod to current F1 cars, while the blacked-out roof flows seamlessly into the front and back ends.

Advanced driver assistance technology on the LaFerrari includes the EF1-Trac F1 traction control system, the latest version of Ferrari's E-Diff differential and SCM-E Frs adjustable magnetic dampers. </li>
